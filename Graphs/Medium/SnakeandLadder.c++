/* Given a snake and ladder board of order 5x6, find the minimum number of dice throws required to reach the destination or last cell (30th cell) from source (1st cell) . 

Example
â€‹For the above board output will be 3 
For 1st throw get a 2
For 2nd throw get a 6
For 3rd throw get a 2

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains two lines. The first line of input contains an integer N denoting the no of ladders and snakes present. Then in the next line are 2*N space separated values a,b which denotes a ladder or a snake at position 'a' which takes to a position 'b'.

Output:
For each test case in a new line print the required answer denoting the min no of dice throws.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 10
1 <= a <= 30
1 <= b <= 30

Example:
Input:
2
6
11 26 3 22 5 8 20 29 27 1 21 9
1
2 30

Output:
3
1

Explanation:
Testcase 1:
For 1st throw get a 2, which contains ladder to reach 22
For 2nd throw get a 6, which will lead to 28
Finally get a 2, to reach at the end 30. Thus 3 dice throws required to reach 30.
